# 99 Problem in Haskell, Erlang & Prolog

[99 Problems](99-problem) are problems to help programmer
to grasp the key idea behind functional programming and
logic programming.

This is my solution to 99 problems in three different 
programming languages including Haskell, Erlang and Prolog.

# Usage
The solutions are in different directories according to
languages, and each problem in a single file. The name 
conversion is `p-xx.hs`, `p-xx.pl` and `p_xx.erl`. 

The codes under miscellaneous directory is some other test
code. They're not related to the problems here.
